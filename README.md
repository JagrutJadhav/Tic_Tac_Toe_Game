# Tic_Tac_Toe_Game
The goal of this work is to explore applications of Finite State Machines in the gaming industries. Tic Tac Toe is one such game that can be implemented using FSM, and which I have designed a program for. The study of FSM in software industries used for developing an algorithm for all the actions related to the game using FSM. The whole game is implemented using C++ on Ubuntu 18.4. The report also showcases the code with all the explanation.

## The Finite State Machine 
To design the state machine we will use modules described above as our states. The inputs will be the keyboard or the condition defined in program. The output of the FSM is the game status which prints the winner or the drawn match. The flow of the game starts with user names. The program initiates the module "input name" to get the names of the players playing the game. After getting both the names of the player, the transition is enabled to the next state when enter is pressed. The player toggle module redirects to the next state "X input" or "0 input" based on the counter flag. The counter increments after the transition is made. X input and 0 input stores replace the grid location with the respective values of X and 0 when the location number is entered. The numeric input transitions to the next state to determine the winning condition. The module "win condition" goes through all the condition in the grid and compares the location number with the win condition. If the condition is satisfied then the state machine transitions to the next state is where the game decides the winner. The transition to the "game decision" occurs when the previous state "win condition" returns "1". Else it checks for the counter value. If the counteris not zero and the condition is not met, it returns -1. In case the counter points to 0, the module returns 0 to indicate the match is a draw. After the game, the user is given the choice to exit the game or to play a new game by entering 'Y' or 'N'. The detailed state diagram is given in the diagram below.
